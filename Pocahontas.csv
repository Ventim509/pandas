In 1616,Pocahontas,John Rolfe,and their son went to England.
Ten of her people came too.
After seven weeks on the ship,they arrived in London.
‘How big London is!’ Pocahontas said.
‘There are hundreds ofhouses here–and thousands of people!’
London was very noisy and exciting.
Pocahontas was interested in everything.
She went into the shops,and looked at the food and the dresses and the books.
She went up and down the River Thames in a boat,and saw the big houses of rich people.
Every day,she saw something new and wonderful.
But London was very dirty,too,because there were so many people.
The river was dirty,and the water was bad.
Two of Pocahontas’ people were ill,and died.
But Pocahontas was happy,and excited.
Every day she visited big houses and talked to rich and important people.
Everybody in London wanted to meet her,to talk to her,to be her friend.
 The King and Queen of England heard about John Rolfe’s wife,the Indian girl from Virginia,and they wanted to meet her,too.
So one day Pocahontas went to visit King James and Queen Anne.
 They asked her about her father,Powhatan.
‘My father is the King of the Algonquin people,’ she said.
‘He has many men and villages.
But our country is quieter than England.
Our people understand the forest and the animals and the rivers.
You can learn from us,and we can learn from you,too.
We must be friends.
Of course we must,’ King James said.
‘Jamestown has my name,so I’m very interested in it.
They talked for some time,and then his wife,Queen Anne,said:‘I have a letter about you,Pocahontas.
It’s from a man called John Smith.
He was your friend,he says,when you were a little girl.
Is that true?’
